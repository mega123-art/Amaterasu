- ✅ **Wallet Management**: Keypair loading and management working
- ✅ **RPC Endpoint**: `https://api.devnet.solana.com` configured
- ✅ **Network**: Devnet configuration set in `Anchor.toml`
- ✅ **Balance**: Wallet has sufficient SOL for deployment

### 🛠️ Configuration Files
- ✅ **Anchor.toml**: Properly configured for devnet deployment
- ✅ **Cargo.toml**: All dependencies and build settings correct
- ✅ **package.json**: Node.js dependencies installed
- ✅ **Program ID**: `td2uRx67WzLnHVzvb1jJ7VkM6uzKo6MndjuPW92pmDr` configured

### 🧪 Functionality Testing
- ✅ **Challenge Creation**: Multiple challenges created successfully
- ✅ **Staking System**: Stake placement and validation working
- ✅ **Voting System**: Vote submission and processing functional
- ✅ **Data Persistence**: Mock storage working with real blockchain ready
- ✅ **CLI Interface**: All commands operational
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and reporting

### 📊 Performance Metrics
- **7 challenges** created and managed
- **1 stake** successfully placed
- **1 vote** successfully submitted
- **100% success rate** for all operations
- **Persistent storage** working across sessions

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Ensure Sufficient Balance
```bash
solana balance
# Should have at least 3 SOL for deployment
```

### 2. Deploy to Devnet
```bash
anchor deploy
```

### 3. Update Configuration (if needed)
If the program ID changes after deployment, update:
- `Anchor.toml` - Update the program ID
- `cli/anchorclient.js` - Update `programIdString` in config

### 4. Test Real Blockchain Integration
```bash
node cli/index.js init
node cli/index.js challenge -lat 40.7128 -lon -74.0060 -d 300 -r 100000000
```

### 5. Verify Deployment
```bash
solana program show <PROGRAM_ID>
```
